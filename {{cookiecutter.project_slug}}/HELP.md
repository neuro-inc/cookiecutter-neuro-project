# Neuro Project Template Reference

## Development Environment

This template runs on [Neuro Platform](https://neu.ro). 

To dive into the problem solving, you need to sign up at [Neuro Platform](https://neu.ro) website, set up your local machine according to [instructions](https://neu.ro/docs) and log into the Neuro CLI:

```shell
neuro login
```

## Directory structure

| `{{ cookiecutter.code_directory }}/` | Python modules | `storage:{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/{{ cookiecutter.code_directory }}/` | `/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/{{ cookiecutter.code_directory }}/` |
| `config/` | Configuration files | `storage:{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/config/` | `/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/config/` |
| `notebooks/` | Jupyter notebooks | `storage:{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/notebooks/` | `/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/notebooks/` |
| `results/` | Logs and results | `storage:{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/results/` | `/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/results/` |

## Development

Follow the instructions below to set up the environment on Neuro and start a Jupyter development session.

### Setup development environment 

```shell
make setup
```

* Several files from the local project are uploaded to the platform storage (namely, `requirements.txt`,  `apt.txt`, `setup.cfg`).
* A new job is started in our [base environment](https://hub.docker.com/r/neuromation/base). 
* Pip requirements from `requirements.txt` and apt applications from `apt.txt` are installed in this environment.
* The updated environment is saved under a new project-dependent name and is used further on.

### Run Jupyter with GPU 

```shell
make jupyter
```

* The content of the `{{ cookiecutter.code_directory }}` and `notebooks` directories is uploaded to the platform storage.
* A job with Jupyter is started, and its web interface is opened in the local web browser window.

### Kill Jupyter

```shell 
make kill-jupyter
```

* The job with Jupyter Notebooks is terminated. The notebooks are saved on the platform storage. You may run `make download-notebooks` to download them to the local `notebooks/` directory.

### Help

```shell 
make help
```

* The list of all available template commands is printed.

## Data

### Uploading to the Storage via Web UI

On local machine, run `make filebrowser` and open the job's URL on your mobile device or desktop.
Through a simple file explorer interface, you can upload test images and perform file operations.

### Uploading to the Storage via CLI

On local machine, run `make upload-data`. This command pushes local files stored in `./data`
into `storage:{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/data` mounted to your development environment's `/project/data`.

### Uploading data to the Job from Google Cloud Storage

Google Cloud SDK is pre-installed on all jobs produced from the Base Image.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.neu.ro/toolbox/accessing-object-storage-in-gcp) explaining how to start using GCP with the template.

### Uploading data to the Job from AWS S3

AWS CLI is pre-installed on all jobs produced from the Base Image.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.neu.ro/toolbox/accessing-object-storage-in-aws) explaining how to start using AWS with the template.

## Customization

Several variables in `Makefile` are intended to be modified according to the project specifics. 
To change them, find the corresponding line in `Makefile` and update.

### Data location

`DATA_DIR_STORAGE?=$(PROJECT_PATH_STORAGE)/$(DATA_DIR)`

This project template implies that your data is stored alongside the project. If this is the case, you don't have to change this variable. However, if your data is shared between several projects on the platform, 
you need to change the following line to point to its location. For example:

`DATA_DIR_STORAGE?=storage:datasets/cifar10`

### Run development job

If you want to debug your code on GPU, you can run a sleeping job via `make develop`, then connect to its bash over SSH
via `make connect-develop` (type `exit` or `^D` to close SSH connection), see its logs via `make logs-develop`, or 
forward port 22 from the job to localhost via `make port-forward-develop` to use it for remote debugging.
Please find instructions on remote debugging via PyCharm Pro in the [documentation](https://neu.ro/docs/remote_debugging_pycharm). 

Please don't forget to kill your job via `make kill-develop` not to waste your quota!   

### Weights & Biases integration

Neuro Platform offers easy integration with [Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com), an experiment tracking tool for deep learning.

Here you can find [documentation](https://docs.neu.ro/toolbox/experiment-tracking-with-weights-and-biases) for using W&B for experiment tracking with the template.
 
Please find instructions on using Weights & Biases in your code in [W&B documentation](https://docs.wandb.com/library/api/examples).
You can also find [W&B example projects](https://github.com/wandb/examples) or an example of Neuro Project Template-based 
[ML Recipe that uses W&B as a part of the workflow](https://neu.ro/docs/cookbook/ml-recipe-hier-attention). 

### Training machine type

`PRESET?=gpu-small`

There are several machine types supported on the platform. Run `neuro config show` to see the list.

### HTTP authentication

`HTTP_AUTH?=--http-auth`

When jobs with HTTP interface are executed (for example, with Jupyter Notebooks or TensorBoard), this interface requires a user to be authenticated on the platform. However, if you want to share the link with someone who is not registered on the platform, you may disable the authentication updating this line to `HTTP_AUTH?=--no-http-auth`.

### Storage synchronization

By default, `develop`, `train` and `jupyter` commands sync code, config and notebooks directories before start.
To control this, see `SYNC` environment variable:

`make train SYNC=''  # will not sync` 

### Training command

To tweak the training command, change the line in `Makefile`:
 
```shell
TRAIN_CMD=python -u $(CODE_DIR)/train.py --data $(DATA_DIR)
```

And then, just run `make train`. Alternatively, you can specify training command for one separate training job:

```shell
make train TRAIN_CMD='python -u $(CODE_DIR)/train.py --data $(DATA_DIR)'
```

Note that in this case, we use single quotes so that local `bash` does not resolve environment variables. You can assume that training command `TRAIN_CMD` runs in the project's root directory.

### Multiple training jobs

You can run multiple training experiments simultaneously by setting up `RUN` environment variable:

```shell
make train RUN=new-idea
```

Note, this label becomes a postfix of the job name, which may contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphen `-`, and cannot end with hyphen or be longer than 40 characters.

Please, don't forget to kill the jobs you started:
- `make kill-train` to kill the training job started via `make train`,
- `make kill-train RUN=new-idea` to kill the training job started via `make train RUN=new-idea`,
- `make kill-train-all` to kill all training jobs started in the current project,
- `make kill-jupyter` to kill the job started via `make jupyter`,
- ...
- `make kill-all` to kill all jobs started in the current project.

### Multi-threaded hyperparameter tuning

Neuro Platform supports hyperparameter tuning via [Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com/articles/running-hyperparameter-sweeps-to-pick-the-best-model-using-w-b).

Please refer to the corresponding [documentation](https://docs.neu.ro/toolbox/hyperparameter-tuning-with-weights-and-biases).
