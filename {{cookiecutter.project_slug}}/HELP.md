# Neuro Project Template Reference

## Development Environment

This template runs on [Neuro Platform](https://neu.ro). 

To dive into the problem solving, you need to sign up at [Neuro Platform](https://neu.ro) website, set up your local machine according to [instructions](https://neu.ro/docs) and log into the Neuro CLI:

```shell
neuro login
```

## Directory structure

| Local directory | Description | Storage URI | Environment mounting point |
|:--------------- |:----------- |:----------- |:-------------------------- | 
| `data/` | Data | `storage:{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/data/` | `/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/data/` | 
| `{{ cookiecutter.code_directory }}/` | Python modules | `storage:{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/{{ cookiecutter.code_directory }}/` | `/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/{{ cookiecutter.code_directory }}/` |
| `config/` | Configuration files | `storage:{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/config/` | `/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/config/` |
| `notebooks/` | Jupyter notebooks | `storage:{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/notebooks/` | `/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/notebooks/` |
| `results/` | Logs and results | `storage:{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/results/` | `/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/results/` |

## Development

Follow the instructions below to set up the environment on Neuro and start a Jupyter development session.

### Setup development environment 

```shell
neuro-flow build myimage
```

* Several files from the local project are uploaded to the platform storage (namely, `requirements.txt`,  `apt.txt`, `setup.cfg`).
* A new job is started in our [base environment](https://hub.docker.com/r/neuromation/base). 
* Pip requirements from `requirements.txt` and apt applications from `apt.txt` are installed in this environment.
* The updated environment is saved under a new project-dependent name and is used further on.

### Run Jupyter with GPU 

```shell
neuro-flow run jupyter
```

* The content of the `{{ cookiecutter.code_directory }}` and `notebooks` directories is uploaded to the platform storage.
* A job with Jupyter is started, and its web interface is opened in the local web browser window.

### Kill Jupyter

```shell 
neuro-flow kill jupyter
```

* The job with Jupyter Notebooks is terminated. The notebooks are saved on the platform storage.

### Help

```shell 
neuro-flow ps
```

* The list of all available template jobs is printed along with their statuses.


## Data

### Uploading to the Storage via Web UI

On local machine, run `neuro-flow run filebrowser` and open the job's URL on your mobile device or desktop.
Through a simple file explorer interface, you can upload test images and perform file operations.

### Run development job

# TODO!

If you want to debug your code on GPU, you can run a sleeping job via `neuro-flow run remote_debug`, then connect to its bash over SSH
via `make connect-develop` (type `exit` or `^D` to close SSH connection), see its logs via `make logs-develop`, or 
forward port 22 from the job to localhost via `make port-forward-develop` to use it for remote debugging.
Please find instructions on remote debugging via PyCharm Pro in the [documentation](https://neu.ro/docs/remote_debugging_pycharm). 

Please don't forget to kill your job via `make kill-develop` not to waste your quota!   


### Training machine type

```yaml
defaults:
  preset: gpu-small-p
```

There are several machine types supported on the platform. Run `neuro config show` to see the list.

### Training command

To tweak the training command, change the last line in this section of `live.yaml`:
 
```yaml
  train:
    image: $[[ images.myimage.ref ]]
    detach: True
    life_span: 10d
    volumes:
      - $[[ volumes.data.ref_ro ]]
      - $[[ volumes.code.ref_ro ]]
      - $[[ volumes.config.ref_ro ]]
      - $[[ volumes.results.ref_rw ]]
    env:
      EXPOSE_SSH: "yes"
      PYTHONPATH: $[[ volumes.code.mount ]]
    bash: |
        cd $[[ flow.workspace ]]
        python -u $[[ volumes.code.mount ]]/train.py --data $[[ volumes.data.mount ]]
```

And then, just run `neuro-flow run train`.

Please, don't forget to kill the jobs you started:
- `neuro-flow kill train` to kill the training job started via `neuro-flow run train`,
- `neuro-flow kill jupyter` to kill the job started via `neuro-flow run jupyter`,
- ...
- `neuro-flow kill ALL` to kill all jobs started in the current project.
